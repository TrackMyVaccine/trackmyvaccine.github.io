When we asked the 106 Kathmandu-based tourism entrepreneurs who took part in our tourism business survey about the kind of policy support that would help them recover from the pandemic, here's what they said:

{% maincolumn 'assets/img/charts/PolicySupportMultiples.png' '<b>What kind of policy level support from the government would be most helpful to your business?</b> <br/><br/> Respondents could select more than one answer for this question. Each pie chart represents the percentage of respondents that choose a given option.' %}

Unsurprisingly, the two most popular answers deal with financial assistance needed to support the economic recovery of tourism businesses. The third popular answer – "regulation at posrt of entries" – is driven by the need for improving mechanisms for enhancing tourism mobility in the region.  


### UNDERSTANDING TOURISM BUSINESSES' NEED FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

According to survey respondents, the pandemic has indeed been disproportionaly harsh to the tourism sector: 18 of our respondents – *nearly one out of every five*  – reported their businesses having to shut down permanently suring the pandemic. Table below shows more details around these businesses.

With the country being closed to tourists for more than a year{%sidenote 'himal-article' 'Link to an article by Himal'%}, small to medium-sized businesses{%sidenote 'mostly_small_med_biz' 'Most of the respondents in our survey were small and medium-sized businesses' %} (based on staff size) operating in the travel or accommodation segment were among the worst hit. 

What’s worse is the fact that 66% (nearly 2 out of every 3) businesses that closed had been in operation for at last 6 years or more. They had survived the 2015 earthquake, even the economic blockade that followed. They couldn’t, however, survive the pandemic.

#### EVEN THOSE WHO SURVIVED ARE BARELY functioning

For the remaining 82 businesses that did manage to pull through, the situation doesn’t look very promising either. As we can see in the charts below, savings have dried up, with a whooping 86% reporting negative savings. And, nearly half of our “survivor” businesses are only just reopening after having temporarily shut down operations for at least a year.
