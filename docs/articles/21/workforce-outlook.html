    <p>This section explores the expectations of the workers regarding the length of impact, the challenges for recovery, and the impact on employment status in future. While the business owners expected the impact to last for short term (less than a year), majority of the workers expect the impact to last for short (less than a year) and medium term (upto two years). The workers and the business owners align in their views regarding the challenges. They mention that gaining back the trust of the tourists along with the financial issues are the major obstacles for recovery. Finally, the majority of the workers are uncertain as to when the situation would get back to normal. This uncertainty has taken both financial and mental toll on the workers- as evident in the other sections of the survey.</p>

<p>An overwhelming majority of the workers expect the impact of the pandemic to last for mid and long term. Around one in three workers expect their livelihood to be impacted for anywhere between six months to a year. Similarly another third expect the impact to last between one and two years. More than a quarter of the workforce expect the impact to last for a long-term, i.e. beyond a duration of two years.  The numbers suggest that even without a second wave, the impact on workers’ livelihood is already significant. The second wave would likely worsen the impact on the workers.</p>

<p>From the workers’ perspective, ensuring health, hygiene, and safety standards is one of the major challenges for the recovery of the sector. More than eight in ten workers identified this as a major challenge. As a service sector, which requires close interaction with the clients, it is a challenge to ensure the safety of both the personnel and the visitors.</p>

Each pie chart represents the percentage of respondents that choose a given option.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Similarly, the current reduction in the number of tourists and the ensuing challenge to gain the trust back were also cited as major challenges. More than two third of the workers responded that reduction in the number of tourists is a concern. As the inflow of tourists is instrumental to keep the businesses afloat, reduction in the number makes it difficult for business operations. As a result, the workers are impacted directly when the operations are impacted. This is only one side of the story though. Gaining the trust of the tourists- that the travel destination is safe or that it is safe to travel in general- is also a major challenge. The business owners also highlight similar concerns.</p>

<p>Financial issues that have hit the industry is another challenge the workers highlighted. Almost two-thirds of the workers mention this as a matter of concern. The finances are closely linked to the flow of tourists, including the perception regarding safety, and the ability to gain the trust back. The financial concerns do not just pertain to the business operations but also to the daily livelihood of the workers. The workers, who are facing financial challenges, have to resort to alternatives- including permanent switch of sectors. This would impact the availability of the workforce- both in the current state and once when the travel resumes.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, when asked to rank the overall challenges, the workers ranked reduction in tourists, ensuring health, hygiene, and safety standards, and financial challenges as the three major challenges the industry faces.</p>

<p>The survey suggests that the uncertainty regarding return to “normalcy” will linger. Three in five workers are uncertain as to when their employment status is likely to return to normal. This uncertainty could be influenced by a number of factors such as perception of the impact due to COVID. Workers who were unemployed during the majority of 2020 might be more pessimistic than those who kept their employment in some form. Said that there is also some optimism in the workers’ group. Similarly, around thirty percent expect their employment status to return to normal within a year. However, it is yet to be assessed if this optimism would persist in the face of the second wave.</p>
