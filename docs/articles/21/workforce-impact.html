    <p>Insights shown in this page have been derived from the responses of 169 participants who took part in the C2M2 Workforce survey.</p>

<h2 id="economic-effects">Economic effects</h2>
<p>In this section, we look at the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the Nepali tourism workforce.</p>

<h3 id="still-searching">STILL SEARCHING</h3>
<p>More than 80% of our respondents reported losing their job at least once during the pandemic. As we can see, a sizable majority (65%) of those who faced unemployent are still without jobs and currently looking for opportunities (see graph below).</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/LostJobsSplit.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure">Note: The group &#8220;working now&#8221; <strong>also includes</strong> those who are presently working in sectors other than tourism, but are interested in re-entering the tourism sector.</figcaption></figure>

<!-- ### income > vocation

<h3 id="pay-cuts-the-new-normal">PAY CUTS: THE New NORMAL?</h3>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/PresentlyEmployedUnemployedSplit.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>It’s equally  worrying to learn that nearly 60% of folks who have jobs work at reduced income levels.</p>
<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/PresentlyEmployedSalaryCutSplit.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>We figured it’s also worth exploring how income losses vary between a) those who managed to retain their employment status throughout the pandemic vs. b) those who lost their jobs once, but managed to find employment again. For reference, here’s what the split looks like graphically.</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/PresentlyEmployedEmplStatusSplit.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>A fifty-fifty split. Now, on to income losses. It appears pay cuts are more common for employees who value job security. Only 3% who remained employed all through the pandemic have managed to retain their pre-pandemic incomes.</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/StayedEmployedSplit.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<h4 id="a-year-of-reduced-income">A Year of reduced income</h4>
<p>63% of our workers who are presently employed have reported not seeing their earnings return to pre-pandemic levels for more than a year now (see graph below).</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/LastDateFullSalaryDistPresentlyEmployed.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure">Note: This chart contains responses from <strong>only those respondents who are presently employed</strong>. <br /> <br /> To be intepreted as: 63% of workers who are presently employed have not seen their salaries return to pre-pandemic levels since &#8220;Before March 2020&#8221;</figcaption></figure>
<p>It appears the situation is going to get even more difficult with the second wave approaching.</p>

<h3 id="dealing-with-the-financial-impact">Dealing with the financial impact</h3>

<p>It’s clear many workers aren’t earning at the levels they previously used to. At this point, let’s try and understand the different financial strategies used by our respondents in dealing with this economic shock brought forth by the crisis.</p>

<h4 id="savings-reduced-to-near-zero">SAVINGS: REDUCED to NEAR-zero</h4>

<p>The indefinite nature of the pandemic has resulted in a situation where many workers (~ 90%) have seen their savings reduced to zero or near-zero levels. This is alarming, especially with the second-wave looming around the corner.</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/SavingsChangeDist.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<h4 id="selling-assets-household-items-are-the-first-to-go">SELLING ASSETS: Household items are the first to go</h4>

<p>Around one in every four respondents had to do away with some of their personal or household assets. Thankfully, only a few of our respondents have had to sell professional equipment (7%) or land and property (7%) so far.</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/SoldStuffMultiples.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<h4 id="borrowing-money-friends-and-family-to-the-rescue">BORROWING MONEY: Friends and family to the rescue</h4>

<p>Our in-person interviews revealed that workers in the tourism sector shy away from borrowing though financial institutions. The reason is that they lack property, real-estate, or other assets that can be provided as collateral. And indeed, our survey results also seem to corroborate with this idea, with more than three-fifths (64%) of our srespondents admit to borrowing exclusively from friends and family.</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/BorrowingSplit.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>The situation is worsened by the fact that at present, nearly all (93%) of our respondents report that they are in some form of debt.</p>
<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/LoanExposure.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>Unfortunately, being in debt – as our data shows – is a very real possibility in the “new normal”.</p>

<h3 id="the-next-six-months">the next six months</h3>

<p>Unsurprisingly – and rather unfortunately – immediate priorities of workers in the tourism industry seem to echo those of our ancestors in the stone age: food and shelter. The COVID-19 pandemic has really take a big economic toll on individuals. With reduced savings, few options for borrowing, and increasing debt, the situation of the Nepalese tourism labour force seems very fragile.</p>

<h2 id="psychosocial-effects">Psychosocial effects</h2>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/PsychologicallyAffectedDist.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps across the world, people globally have reported an increase in issues pertaining to their mental health and psychosocial wellbeing. The same has been seen among the tourism workers<label for="Two" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="Two" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">“My energy to work more, take tourism to new heights has died. I used to donate 5% of my income to charity and now I dont feel like working anymore. Rather, dont even feel like talking.” </span>. Almost all the workers have reported some form of effects on their mental health and psychosocial wellbeing. Our in-person interviews have reflected the same pattern, the causes seem to be the lockdown and dwindling finances.</p>

<p>Digging deep, the majority of the workers say that they find it difficult not to think about the situation and feel increased social pressure<label for="Two" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="Two" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">“The income was great, so the impression in family was good too. Now, the situation has changed.” </span>. Other effects are an increase in anxiousness, nightmares, and guilt. Such psychological impacts transition into social relationships including one’s relationship with the family members and other people around them. Given that this is a multiple-choice question, such feelings are overlapping among the respondent workers.</p>

<p>Despite almost all the workers reporting some form of effect on their mental health and psychosocial wellbeing, only a fraction reportedly sought medical help<label for="Two" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="Two" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Most of the respondents of our in-person interviews reported some form of effects on their mental health. Most, however, opted for informal coping mechanisms including meditation, yoga and music classes. </span>.</p>
