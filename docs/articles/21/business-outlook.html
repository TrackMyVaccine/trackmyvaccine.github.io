    <p>This section presents the findings related to the future outlook of the industry. It explores the expectation of the owners pertaining to the length of disruptions, the impact on their income, and the challenges the businesses are facing. The survey finds that the majority of the business owners expect the disruptions to last for around a year. More than twenty percent of the businesses expect to have no or little income compared to 2019. Similarly, challenges related to gaining back trust and managing finances surface prominently among the business owners.</p>

<p>Majority of the business owners, around sixty five percent, expected the disruption to last less than a year. Only around one in ten business owners expected the disruption to last for more than two years. It is evident that during the time of the survey, the majority of the business owners did not envision the second wave of COVID-19 to impact their business. These estimates could likely change given the second wave that has hit Nepal and the ensuing government imposed lockdown and travel restrictions, including suspension of international flights.</p>

<p>Similarly, the majority of the business owners expect their revenues to be affected during 2021, which aligns with their expectation of how long the impact of COVID-19 will last. Around two in five business owners expect to earn no or negligible income in 2021. Only around one in twenty, business owners expect the income level to be at similar or a higher level than that of 2019.</p>

<p>These numbers suggest that even without the projection of impact due to the second wave, the business owners had a bleak outlook for their earnings. The second wave would likely exacerbate the situation even further.</p>

Each pie chart represents the percentage of respondents that choose a given option.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The biggest challenges for the business owners pertain to reviving the touristsâ€™ confidence and managing finances. Around two thirds of the business owners expect that winning the confidence of tourists and guests is a major challenge. It could be that the business owners expect travelers to bide their time before making travel plans. Factors such as the rate of vaccination in a country, the availability of flights, the overall economic outlook in the origin countries/ places play a role in determining the flow of tourists. Similarly, the behavioral change required, shifting from a largely sedentary lockdown lifestyle to a more active travel lifestyle could also be another factor that could determine when travels resume. More research in this topic will likely reveal nuanced insights.</p>

<p>The second and third biggest difficulties of the business owners pertain to managing finances. Around sixty percent of the respondents are concerned about a shortage of cash flow to sustain their operations. The shortage of access to loans and additional funds compounds this shortage of cash. Two in five business owners also mention that accessing additional resources is a major concern for them. Similarly, understanding the demands of source markets and ensuring safety for tourists and workforce are also other major concerns for the business owners.</p>

<p>Majority of the business owners have expectations from the government to take a central role supporting their businesses. Around one in two business owners expect government agencies such as ministries, Department of Tourism, and the Tourism Board, among other departments, to provide support. Our preliminary research suggests that they pertain to eco-system level support such as ease of travel for tourists (limited or no quarantine period for travelers with negative PCR tests), tax-subsidies for businesses, utility subsidies, and access to emergency funds and grants. Around thirteen percent of the business owners also expect support from financial institutions and unions and associations. The support from the financial institutions would be instrumental in helping sustain the operations and that from the associations would be important in voicing the concerns of businesses to the government entities.</p>

<p>The role of informal networks such as friends and family is also important to sustain the businesses. More than one in ten business owners expect their family and friends to support their ventures. This number seems low compared to the informal discussions and research the C2M2 team conducted. This could be because of multiple reasons. The owners could have exhausted support from informal sources in early months of impact, thus leaving them with little space to return to the same sources for support. It could also be that the owners have limited social capital to rely on. Further research on this topic would yield more nuanced insights for the policymakers as to the role of informal networks and institutions in supporting businesses during the times of COVID.</p>
