    <p>With 77% of businesses being closed at least once during the pandemic, majority of them reporting a revenue of almost zero in 2020, and most of the business houses falling into the COVID-induced debt for their survival, this section lists down these business’ expected interventions which they think will help them out of this predicaments.</p>
<figure><img src="/kathmandu/assets/img/charts/NextSixMonthsBusinessProblemsMultiples.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"><b>Within the next six months, which of the following problems will your business face?</b> <br /><br /> Respondents could select more than one answer for this question. Each pie chart represents the percentage of respondents that choose a given option.</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="pre-existing-burdens-become-even-heavier">PRE-EXISTING BURDENS BECOME EVEN HEAVIER</h3>

<p>Two-thirds of the businesses reported that they will face difficulties in paying back their existing loans. These 58 businesses, when asked to choose the type of assistance that will help them pay off their debts, 59% reported they prefer reduced interest loans whereas 41% prefer to have their loan payback periods extended instead.</p>

<h4 id="customers-will-be-king---more-than-ever-before">CUSTOMERS WILL BE KING - MORE THAN EVER BEFORE</h4>
<p>Two-thirds of the businesses also reported that acquiring enough customers to survive will be a major issue for the next six months.</p>

<p>40% of such businesses believe that they do not have enough resources to understand the needs and aspirations of the source markets that their businesses cater to. 34% of businesses are looking for direct business generation programs from different sources such as trade fairs, direct advertisements, etc. The remaining 26% opine that upgrading their digital marketing skills will be the key to survive in the coming months.</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu/assets/img/charts/PreferredTaxAssistanceDist.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>42% of businesses prefer the amount of taxes to be reduced, whereas 29% of businesses think that direct VAT return is the best intervention for them. Businesses are not very keen on deferring taxes or just exemption of fine on taxes.</p>

<h4 id="source">SOURCE</h4>

<p>Incidentally, almost three-fourths of the respondents prefer to receive financial assistance from the government. Only 22% businesses prefer to acquire additional loans from banks, whereas only 6% of businesses will be looking to acquire such loans from existing shareholders or new shareholders (through acquisitions, mergers or consolidations with other businesses)</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu/assets/img/charts/PreferredSourceFinAssistanceDist.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>For the businesses that will be seeking additional funds, two-thirds of them prefer longer-term subsidized loans whereas only one-third prefer short-term loans without collateral.</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu/assets/img/charts/MostHelpfulFundsAssistanceDist.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<h4 id="labor">LABOR</h4>
<p>28% of businesses have reported that they anticipate to face labor-related issues within the next six months. However, only 8% of these businesses anticipate that access to skilled/semi-skilled workers will be their major issue. 44% said that a government policy to not increase minimum wage rates for their next some time will be most helpful to them. On the other hand, a sizable proportion of businesses (48%) see vaccinating their employees as a major concern for them.</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu/assets/img/charts/PreferredLaborAssistanceDist.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="policy-support">POLICY SUPPORT</h3>
<p>We asked all the respondents what types of government policies would be helpful for their businesses. Each business could choose upto three such policies.</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu/assets/img/charts/PolicySupportMultiples.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"><b>What kind of policy level support from the government would be most helpful to your business?</b> <br /><br /> Respondents could select more than one answer for this question. Each pie chart represents the percentage of respondents that choose a given option.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Two-thirds of the respondents have reported ‘establishment of a tourism protection fund’ will help them better deal with this type of crisis. Half the respondents are seeking for better government policies around financial assistance. Only 13% marked ‘establishment of job retention fund’ as one of their top three choices.</p>

<p>43% of respondents believe that the port of entries into Nepal should be more tightly regulated. Interestingly, only 8% of respondents think that a Training of Trainers programs on Health and Hygiene Sanitation should be one of their top three choices among the given list. An even lower (6%) seek government assistance in skill enhancement programs for their human resources.</p>

<p>A quarter of the respondents have asked the government to establish an authentic source of information regarding COVID-related information.</p>

<p>Somehow, only 24% of respondents think that a government verification system of labelling businesses as safe and unsafe (such as green, yellow and red stickers) is useful to them.</p>
