    <p>Owing to the high percentages of workers who’ve lost their jobs and are yet to find employment, it is not surprising that the top three sought help are discounted borrowings, opportunities of employment, and grants – as reported by 25.2%, 17.5% and 16.5% of the respondents respectively.</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/NeedsRnk1Dist.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure">Respondents were presented with the options shown on the chart, and ask to select all that apply. They were then asked to pick the most important from all of their personal choices. <br /> <br />Graph to the left shows the distribution what respondents considered most important.</figcaption></figure>

<p>It seems that the other types of help like repaying their existing loans, or developing new skills, reduction of taxes, etc. are almost afterthoughts in their current situations.</p>

<h3 id="financial-needs">FINANCIAL NEEDS</h3>
<p>Two-thirds of them have reported that borrowings (i.e. additional funds) at discounted rates of interests will be very helpful. 54% are also looking for grants, while 38% are looking for discounted interest rates on their existing loans. A quarter of the respondents have also cited extension or deferral of loan payments will be helpful.</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/FinancialNeedsMultiple.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"><b>Which of the following forms of financial support will help you minimize the effects of the pandemic?</b> <br /><br /> Respondents could select more than one answer for this question. Each pie chart represents the percentage of respondents that choose a given option.</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="health-related-needs">HEALTH RELATED NEEDS</h3>
<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/HealthNeedsMultiple.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"><b>Which of the following forms of health related support will help you minimize the effects of the pandemic?</b> <br /><br /> Respondents could select more than one answer for this question. Each pie chart represents the percentage of respondents that choose a given option.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Although, almost all the respondents have reported at least one health and psychosocial impact of this pandemic on their well-being, less than 3 out of 10 are actively seeking medical help for the same. Could social stigma around those seeking mental health counseling could be a cause?</p>

<h3 id="professional-needs">PROFESSIONAL NEEDS</h3>
<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/ProfessionalNeedsMultiple.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"><b>Which of the following forms of professional development support will help you minimize the effects of the pandemic?</b> <br /><br /> Respondents could select more than one answer for this question. Each pie chart represents the percentage of respondents that choose a given option.</figcaption></figure>

<p>47% of respondents have reported that employment is one of the top three helps that they are seeking at the moment.</p>

<p>54% are also looking for some sort of professional development training or retraining. Most of these people are involved in <strong>__</strong>__ sub-sector within tourism.</p>

<p>45% of the respondents, on the other hand, are actively looking to develop new skills.</p>

<p>However, more than 50% of tourism workers that we surveyed are asking for social security benefits. These people are/were involved in _____ sub-sector within the tourism sector.</p>
