    <h3 id="what-hit-them-hard-the-common-detriments">WHAT HIT THEM HARD: THE COMMON DETRIMENTS</h3>
<p>We asked each business which factors adversely affected them during the pandemic.</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/BizMostDamagingFactorsMultiples.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"><b>Which of the following factors affected your business operations during the pandemic?</b> <br /><br /> Respondents could select more than one answer for this question. Each pie chart represents the percentage of respondents that choose a given option.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Almost 50% of respondents cited the second-order effects of the government-imposed lockdown, such as lack of mobility and inaccessibility of the required services, as one of the prominent reasons that their business suffered. The most common cause was the reduced volume of business, which most probably is also because of the lockdown that severely restricted the movement of people (customers) for these businesses.</p>

<p>Another prominent detriment was the lack of financial resources required to keep these businesses running smoothly. It seems that when the lockdown was imposed, the number of COVID cases were also slowly on the rise, as reported by 33% of the respondents.</p>

<p>Overall, it hints that the government imposed the lockdown before other effects of COVID, such as shortage of human resources, COVID-affected employees, etc. could manifest and affect these businesses. Had the situation been worse when the lockdown had been first implemented, one would suspect these percentages to be higher than 13% and 9%.</p>

<h4 id="what-hit-them-hard-the-major-culprits">WHAT HIT THEM HARD: THE MAJOR CULPRITS</h4>

<p>Each respondent was also asked to choose three major factors that affected their business operations. Again, almost 4 out of every 10 businesses reported that the reduced volume of business hit them the hardest. The second-most prominent factor was the lack of adequate financial resources, which could be a direct result of the reduced volume of business.</p>

<h3 id="what-actions-they-took">WHAT ACTIONS THEY TOOK</h3>
<p>This section explains the different actions that these businesses took along the various dimensions as a response to the COVID-induced difficulties.</p>

<h4 id="workforce">WORKFORCE</h4>

<p>Asking workers to take unpaid leave or laying off these workers seemed to be the most common practice, unfortunately. With reduced or zero revenues as reported by most businesses in 2020, these steps were probably the preferred method of slashing fixed costs.</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/BizWorkforceActionsMultiples.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"><b>Which of the following workforce related actions did your business take due to the pandemic?</b> <br /><br /> Respondents could select more than one answer for this question. Each pie chart represents the percentage of respondents that choose a given option.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Other milder interventions like reducing working hours, or decreasing employee benefits, or introducing rotational employment seemed to be less popular actions among the businesses. However, only 22% of respondents reported actually asking their workers to work for reduced pay. 16% asked workers to take paid leave. Perhaps these are indicators of reduced or no business, and hence the businesses saw not much sense in retaining these workers.</p>

<h4 id="borrowing">Borrowing</h4>

<p>Owing to the lack of financial resources, half of the businesses reported they tried to take loans. It is inconclusive, however, that the remaining half either did not take trying loans even if they needed it, or they did not need it at all.</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/LoanNoLoanSplit.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>Only 9% of respondents said that they were able to acquire a loan easily. As many as twice that number did take a loan but only by going through significantly difficult processes. 26% said they tried to take loans but they could not.</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/BizLoanActionsMultiples.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"><b>Which of the following loan related impacts did your business have to face due to the pandemic?</b> <br /><br /> Respondents could select more than one answer for this question. Each pie chart represents the percentage of respondents that choose a given option.</figcaption></figure>

<p>xxxxxxx% of businesses had reported that they already have existing loans. yyyyyy% of those said that they faced difficulties in paying them back during the pandemic.</p>

<h4 id="asset-liquidity">Asset liquidity</h4>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/TrySellNoTrySellSplit.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>
<p>As high as 62% of businesses tried to sell or rent out some of their assets during this pandemic. 34% were able to sell some assets, and 10% successfully rented out their assets. 26% of those who wanted to sell their assets failed to find willing buyers.</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/BizAssetActionsMultiples.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"><b>Which of the following asset related impacts did your business have to face due to the pandemic?</b> <br /><br /> Respondents could select more than one answer for this question. Each pie chart represents the percentage of respondents that choose a given option.</figcaption></figure>

<h4 id="investments-and-costs">Investments and costs</h4>
<p>The Government of Nepal had declared 2020 as the Visit Nepal year. The nation had ambitious goals of bringing in over 1.5 million tourists. The Visit Nepal 2020 got cancelled in March, right before the first lockdown.</p>

<p>We had asked if the businesses had made significant investments targeting Visit Nepal 2020. 43% of businesses said they did. 32% said that they cancelled or postponed their investment plans.</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/VnInvestmentSplit.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>80% of businesses reported that they could not cover their operating costs (electricity, rent, etc.)</p>
<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/BizCostActionsMultiples.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"><b>Which of the following cost related impacts did your business have to face due to the pandemic?</b> <br /><br /> Respondents could select more than one answer for this question. Each pie chart represents the percentage of respondents that choose a given option.</figcaption></figure>

<h4 id="location-location-location">Location, location, location</h4>
<p>Migration of people is expected during this type of crisis. We also wanted to know if this is true for the businesses. Almost 4 out of 10 businesses actually tried to change their office/business to a different location. 13% of respondents did actually move to a different location. 26% tried to migrate but could not; while a quarter of our respondents had to close one or more of their offices/branches completely.</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/TryMoveNoTryMoveSplit.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/BizLocationActionsMultiples.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"><b>Which of the following location related impacts did your business have to face due to the pandemic?</b> <br /><br /> Respondents could select more than one answer for this question. Each pie chart represents the percentage of respondents that choose a given option.</figcaption></figure>

<h4 id="operations">OPERATIONS</h4>
<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/ShutNoShutSplit.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<h4 id="equity-and-ownership">EQUITY AND ownership</h4>
<h5 id="staying-afloat-by-selling-stakes">Staying afloat by selling stakes</h5>
<p>35% of business also resorted to selling a part of its ownership stakes in order to survive. Only 9% succeeded, however. The remaining 26% could not find willing buyers. It is not surprising that not many are</p>

<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/TrySellEquityOrNotSplit.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="/kathmandu-interim-report/assets/img/charts/BizEquityActionsMultiples.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"><b>Which of the following equity related impacts did your business have to face due to the pandemic?</b> <br /><br /> Respondents could select more than one answer for this question. Each pie chart represents the percentage of respondents that choose a given option.</figcaption></figure>

<h5 id="selling-the-entire-business">Selling the entire business</h5>
<p>In a dismal looking picture, a quarter of our respondents reported that they tried to sell their entire business because of the pandemic - read some resembling stories here. However, only 1% could sell their business, whereas 23% failed to find a willing buyer.</p>
