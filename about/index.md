People like _____, _____ and ____ represent millions of tourism workers whose lives have been affected by COVID-19. Due to its very nature, tourism was one of the first sectors to be afflicted by the pandemic, and it will be one of the lasts to recover. This means about a million families' livelihoods hang in the balance as Nepal braces for the possible second-wave of COVID-19 in 2021

This report is targeted for tourism policy-makers, associations and unions. It attempts to supplement their actions by giving them the latest picture of: 

- COVID’s impacts on tourism businesses and workers

### What we did

We have been working closely with different stakeholders from Nepal's tourism stakeholders for the last ___ months. In this course, we've come a little closer to understanding the ~~plight of these folks~~ during the pandemic.

In making this report, we have collected latest data from the field, and collectively looked at data-driven narratives that help these stakeholders understand and communicate the present impact, preparedness, and needs of people working in the tourism sector.
