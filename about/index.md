For the last seven months, Kathmandu Living Labs has been working to document the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as felt by tourism industry in Nepal.

We met with individuals working in tourism, individuals who own or used to own tourism-related businesses, and individuals working for the sectorâ€™s recovery in some capacity (government officials, etc.). We listened to them, and gathered information around their lived experience, through informal interviews, through focused group discussions, and through surveys. When doing this, we focused on the economic and psychosocial impacts that the pandemic has had on them. We also tried to capture their needs for the next few months, in the hope that this information would be useful for future decisions made for the industry.

Through this report, we want to share some intermediate findings and recommendations, based on the data we received through interviews, and through our ongoing surveys targeted at tourism workforce and tourism businesses. These surveys, for which data collection started in the month of April 2021, have so far been filled by 206 individuals working in the tourism sector, and 106 individuals who own or manage the operations of different tourism businesses in and around the capital city of Kathmandu.

Analysing the data we recieved so far, we think that the information gathered can already provide useful direction to lobbyists, decision-makers, and well-wishers of the tourism industry, as they take next steps to mitigate the effects, and support the recovery of a very important sector in Nepal.
