In this section, we look at the economic impact that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on the Nepali tourism workforce. Insights shown below have been derived from the responses of 107 participants who took part in the C2M2 Workforce survey.

### STILL LOOKING FOR JOBS
Around 90% of our respndents reported losing their job at least once during the pandemic. While a very small proportion of these workers have been successful in gaining employment, a sizable majority are still without jobs and currently looking for economic opportunities.

### PAY CUTS: THE New NORMAL?
Even with those lucky few people who have managed to hold on to their jobs (10%, see chart below) throughout the pandemic, living with a pay cut has become a harsh reality.

This should explain why most were not able to hold on to their jobs, as most guides are hired by tourists. See <a>survey demographics</a>' %}


Around 91% of our respondents reported that earnings haven't gotten back to pre-covid levels. To make matters worse, 80% of our respondents reported not seeing their earnings return to pre-covid levels for more than a year now (see graph below).

It appears the situation is going to get even more difficult with the second wave approaching.


### Dealing with the financial impact

Our survey provides some useful insight to different financial strategies used by our respondents in dealing with this economic shock brought forth by the crisis.


#### SAVINGS: REDUCED to NEAR-zero

The indefinite nature of the pandemic has resulted in a situation where many workers (~ 90%) have seen their savings reduced to zero or near-zero levels. This is alarming, especially with the second-wave looming around the corner.

#### SELLING ASSETS: Household items are the first to go

Around one in every five respondents has had to do away with some of their household assets. Thankfully, only a few of our respondents have had to sell professional equipment (7%) or land and property (7%) so far.

#### BORROWING MONEY: Friends and family to the rescue

Our in-person interviews revealed that workers in the tourism sector shy away from borrowing though financial institutions. The reason is that they lack property, real-estate, or other assets that can be provided as collateral. And indeed, our survey results also seem to corroborate with this idea, with nearly three-quarters (75%) of our srespondents admit to borrowing exclusively from friends and family.

The situation is worsened by the fact that at present, nearly all (98%) of our respondents report that they are in some form of debt.

Unfortunately, it appears being in debt is now part of the new normal.
