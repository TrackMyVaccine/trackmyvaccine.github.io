Our survey provide some insight around the economic state of the tourism workforces. The section presents our findings.

### STILL LOOKING FOR JOBS
Around 90% of our respndents reported losing their job at least once during the pandemic. While a very small proportion of these workers have been successful in gaining employment, a sizable majority are still without jobs and currently looking for economic opportunities.

### PAY CUTS: THE New NORMAL?
Even with those lucky few people who have managed to hold on to their jobs (10%, see chart below) throughout the pandemic, living with a pay cut has become a harsh reality.

This should explain why most were not able to hold on to their jobs, as most guides are hired by tourists. See <a>survey demographics</a>' %}


Around 91% of our respondents reported that earnings haven't gotten back to pre-covid levels. To make matters worse, 80% of our respondents reported not seeing their earnings return to pre-covid levels for more than a year now (see graph below).

It appears the situation is going to get even more difficult with the second wave approaching.


### How to recover from a pandemic?

In this section, we examine the different financial decisions made by tourism workers in order to overcome the pandemic. In doing this, we uncover some intersting -- but obvious, in hindsight -- insights that reveal how people deal with economic hardship/ 

#### SAVINGS REDUCED to NEAR-zero
The indefinite nature of the pandemic has resulted in a situation where many workers have seen their saving reduced to zero or near-zero levels. This is alarming, especially with the second-wave looming around the corner.
