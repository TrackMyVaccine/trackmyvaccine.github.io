The following section gives a peek into the impacts of the COVID-19 on the tourism businesses of Kathmandu.  

### A HUGE LOSS
Except for a negligible fraction, almost all the tourism businesses shut down during the pandemic. A big chunk (77%) closed temporarily, significantly 17% may never open again. The closure, in turn, has cascading effects on the employment, income, and livelihoods of the people associated with it apart from the loss of years of experience gained by those people in the field of Nepali tourism.

Among the businesses that were temporarily shut down, more than half were shut for more than a year. Only a negligible percentage were shut for less than 3 months.

### Dropping Revenues and negative savings

For the majority of the businesses, there was no revenue during the pandemic. Even for the rest, revenues had decreased drastically, as shown in the graph below.

A part of this lack of revenue would definitely have translated to 87% of the businesses ending up with negative savings i.e. having to borrow money to sustain themselves. This further added debt i.e. an increase in the future running costs.

### A steep surge in layoffs - workforces emptying to zero

Consequently, the overall workforce size took a major hit. 37% of the workforce emptied to zero, three fourth of the workforce were laid off in 28% of the businesses, half in 14%, and one-fourth in 9%.
