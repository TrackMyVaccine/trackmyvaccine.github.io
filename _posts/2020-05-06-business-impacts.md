Among the businesses that were temporarily shut down, more than half were shut for more than a year. This number comes up despite the first lockdown was imposed for approximately four months and the second lockdown was imposed for  *months. Only a negligible percentage were shut for less than 3 months.

A part of this lack of revenue would definitely have translated to 87% of the businesses ending up with negative savings i.e. having to borrow money to sustain themselves. This further added debt i.e. an increase in the future running costs.
