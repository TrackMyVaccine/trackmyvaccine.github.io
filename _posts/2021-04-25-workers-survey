This section describes the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Nepali tourism workforce.

Tourism is a big, important industry in Nepal. In 2019, the sector created **1.03 million jobs**, and employed almost 7% of the Nepali workforce {% sidenote '1' 'World Travel and Tourism Council (2020), Travel & Tourism Economic Impact. Country report available on request.' %}. What makes the industry even more important, is the fact that it **contributes to nearly a third of Nepal's earnings from exports.** 

As part of C2M2 Kathmandu, we conducted a survey in collaboration with 107 tourism professionals from Kathmandu to understand the toll COVID-19 has taken on people who depend on tourism for their livelihoods. 





### still looking
Of the 107 people surveyed, nearly 80% of the population report that they are currently out of work. While some of them have left entirely, most of them are currently looking for opportunities to re-engage themselves in the tourism sector.

### Severe financial impacts
A very small fraction of our respondents were able to retain their jobs from before the pandemic. Salary cuts were a common occurence.

With tourist numbers reduced to near-zero for months, professionals in the travel and adventure space seem to be the hardest hit. More than 95% of our respondents report income losses of more than 50% compared to 2019.

### AN INFORMAL INDUSTRY

Many tourism experts argue that the contribution of tourism to Nepal's national employment is much larger than what the numbers say. They point out that official statistics often leave out thousands of members of the informal tourism labour force: the daily-wage cook making breakfast at base camp, the young adult helping out in her family run tea-house after school, or the rickshaw-wala 
 dai enthusiastically showing tourists around Thamel.


#### A low barrier to entry 

Staying in the job market is difficult for idividuals with low educational attainment.  

And indeed, early results from our survey seem to support this hypothesis. Almost 80% of our respondents reported not having to sign any formal contract with their employers.

### A seasonal industry


### COMPLETE DEPENDENCE


### UNEMPLOYED FOR MONTHS   

And indeed, that's what we observed as well. Many of our respondents reported 


It is therefore unfortunate to see that most of our respondents, are currently unemployed.
