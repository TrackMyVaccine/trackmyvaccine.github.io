  TrackMyVaccine is a volunteer-led initiative of creating and managing an open database of the COVID-19 vaccines in
  Nepal. This citizen campaign tracks the management and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the country from multiple
  reliable sources and informs citizens of their status through an easy-to-navigate comprehensive online dashboard.

<p>In early March 2021, Nepal became one of the first Asian countries to <a

    target="_blank">receive
    COVID-19 vaccines through COVAX</a>, after
  being one of the first countries in the world to <a target="_blank"

    COVID-19 vaccination back in January 2021</a>. It was believed
  that this support would accelerate the vaccination efforts of the country. Two months down the line, there is dismay
  among the general public as the 1.3million senior citizens await their second jab of Covishield vaccine. This has been
  further fueled by the media stories showing vaccines, which are already in limited stocks, are being accessed by those
  in power using personal channels. To a large extent, the general public relies on media posts to keep themselves
  updated about the vaccine landscape (at least on the management and implementation side). Despite significant demand,
  the government has not made COVID-19 vaccines management data public. As more <a target="_blank"

    on vaccines aid pops in</a>,
  transparency and accuracy of data on real time vaccine management becomes all the more important. After all, lack of
  transparency, or worse, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/TrackMyVac/status/1405735000931110919">misinformation</a>
  will serve only to erode public trust in government and related stakeholders, which is not ideal.
</p>
<p>
  TrackMyVaccine campaign takes the COVID-19 vaccine information into the public domain. This will not only help an
  individual to stay informed on the management, but support the Government and relevant agencies in efficient and
  equitable distribution.
